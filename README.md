# FUTURE# Future Interns - SOC Analyst Internship
## Task 2: Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

**Tools:** Splunk Enterprise (SIEM), Kali Linux
**Domain:** Security Operations Center (SOC)

### 📌 Project Description
In this task, I simulated the role of a SOC Analyst. I set up **Splunk Enterprise** on a Kali Linux environment to ingest and analyze server logs containing simulated cyber threats. My objective was to detect suspicious activities, classify incidents, and formulate an incident response plan.

### 🔍 Key Findings
During the log analysis, I identified two critical security incidents:
1. **Critical Malware Outbreak:** Detected multiple hosts infected with Trojans, Rootkits, and Ransomware signatures.
2. **Brute Force Attack:** Identified a high volume of failed login attempts targeting specific user accounts, indicating a coordinated password attack.

### 📂 Files Included
- **SOC_Incident_Report.pdf**: A detailed report outlining the incident timeline, evidence, and remediation strategies.
- **Screenshots**: Evidence captured from the Splunk dashboard showing the malware alerts and login failures.
